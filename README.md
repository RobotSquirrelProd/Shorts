# Shorts

## Project Description

This repository stores the code examples used in the short “how-to” videos
posted on the [RobotSquirrelProductions
website](https://robotsquirrelproductions.com/vibration-data-visualization/) and
[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3F8gIDlvlyzcyVPFT_q5GA). I
plan to update this repository as I release new videos and posts, so check back
for updates.

I have a short description of each project below.

## Spectral Analysis (Single-Sided FFT) with Python and Jupyter

This video provides a short tutorial showing how to calculate and plot a
spectrum (single-sided FFT of a real-valued signal) in Python using a Jupyter
Notebook.

The first half of the video is setting up the time domain signal, and the last
half is the FFT portion.

## Spectral Analysis (Single-Sided FFT) with Microsoft (R) Excel

This video provides a short tutorial showing how to calculate and plot a
spectrum (single-sided FFT of a real-valued signal) in Microsoft (R) Excel. The
intent is to provide a high-level tutorial on calculating an FFT, so the video
skips the math and theoretical background. Please let me know in the comments if
more or less explanation would be helpful.

After completing the FFT calculation, the video shows some of the effects of
spectral leakage and offers a few tips to reduce the problem.

## How to Plot CSV Data in Python Using Pandas

This tutorial shows how to import a comma-separated values (CSV) file into
Jupyter using Python and visualize the data with the matplotlib library.
