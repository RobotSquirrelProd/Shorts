# Shorts

## Project Description

This repository stores the code examples used in the short “how-to” videos
posted on the [RobotSquirrelProductions
website](https://robotsquirrelproductions.com/vibration-data-visualization/) and
[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3F8gIDlvlyzcyVPFT_q5GA). I
plan to update this repository as I release new videos and posts, so check back
for updates.

I have a short description of each project below.

## Spectral Analysis (Single-Sided FFT) with Python and Jupyter

This video provides a short tutorial showing how to calculate and plot a
spectrum (single-sided FFT of a real-valued signal) in Python using a Jupyter
Notebook.

The first half of the video is setting up the time domain signal, and the last
half is the FFT portion.
